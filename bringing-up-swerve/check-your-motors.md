# Check your motors

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure your CAN ID's are unique! There is a known issue where if the CAN ID of your REV Power Distribution Hub is the same as the CAN ID of the SparkMAX it will **cause the SparkMAX to not move** the motor!
{% endhint %}

## Physically Label each component with their ID's

There is no easier way to screw up configuring a swerve drive (or any other kind of drive system) than putting the wrong channel number, CAN ID, or even CAN bus (if your device is on a CANivore) for a component whether it is the drive motor, angle motor, absolute encoder, or gyroscope. Some components don't have ID's like NavX's and instead have a few different `type`'s which define the connection method (`navx_spi`, `navx_usb`, `navx_i2c`) these just have to be known beforehand.

I strongly suggest you find the information from the [getting-to-know-your-robot](../configuring-yagsl/getting-to-know-your-robot/ "mention")sheet before you start configuring your robot.

## Motors should spin counter clockwise positive

When you spin your motor while the robot is disabled you will notice `swerve/modules/.../Raw Angle Encoder` (angle/steering/azimuth relative encoder) and `swerve/modules/.../Raw Absolute Encoder` (absolute encoder) . Both of these should increase while the motor is spun counter clockwise. For more information see here.

## Conversion Factors and your motors

Conversion factors are applied to your motor convert from native units (usually _**rotations**_) to degrees for steering/azimuth/angle motors, and meters for drive motors. Conversion factors are only relevant to motor controllers, except if there is an absolute encoder attached to your motor controller.

## The Absolute Encoder Offset

The absolute encoder offset is what allows your swerve module to maintain the wheel orientation between power offs. It is vital to a functioning swerve drive.

1. Line up all wheels so that the bevels are facing to the left like this.

2. Deploy your code.
3. **DO NOT ENABLE YOUR ROBOT!**
4. Open your driver dashboard.
5.

7. Take note of the `swerve/modules/.../Raw Absolute Encoder` value's and use them for `absoluteEncoderOffset` in the module JSONs.

#### Special note to MAXSwerve teams!

When you align using the MAXSwerveModules and find the `absoluteEncoderOffset` for each module you may need to **+/-`90` from the `absoluteEncoderOffset`** to correct the module position. The `absoluteEncoderInverted` must also be `true` in every module configuration as well.
