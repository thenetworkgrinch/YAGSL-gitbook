# Swerve Information

## Every swerve drive is different!

Even with COTS swerve modules like SDS MK4, and MaxSwerve. Every robot has different dimensions and should not be treated the same.

## Measure module locations

Try to measure module locations in CAD to be as precise as possible and go from the center of the wheel to the center of the robot over the "front" and "left" relative to the robot. The units for this is inches!

## How to measure module locations (by Team 5010)

1. Lay the robot on its side and rotate the wheels perpendicular to the direction youâ€™re measuring.
2. Measure to the outside of each wheel and subtract 1 wheel width to get the measurement from center to center.
3. Do the same thing in the other direction.
