# Getting to know your robot

## Pre-requisite details to configure YAGSL

YAGSL is configured for your robot by YOU! We have example configurations which may or may not work for you. The pre-requisite details about your robot are set by through vendor clients and physical characteristics of your robot. Below is a near comprehensive list of features of your robot you must know before configuring YAGSL.
